#xxxx: Transformer-based Generative Adversarial network for 3D CT-to-MRI modality translation
This repository is an official implementation of the work named ""
#Introduction
This network adopts a dual-input generative adversarial network(GAN). 
It mainly consists of three parts:
the convolutional branch[High Resolution Part] contained in the Generator is dedicate to extract the local feature information, 
while the transformer branch[Low Resolution Part] contained in the Generator is focus on the extraction of global long-range dependencies. 
The Discriminator is a fully-convolutional network which is used to distinguish the realness of generated MRI volumes.
